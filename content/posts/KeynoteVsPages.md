Employees and students often need to create attractive documents for presentations and text documents. Popular commercial software for creating great-looking documents includes PowerPoint, Keynote and Pages. PowerPoint is a Microsoft product, while Apple makes Keynote and Pages. While there are similarities between the three programs, there are also major differences. Choosing between the three when creating a document depends on your needs.

## The Basics

PowerPoint, Keynote and Pages are all included as part of office suites, as well as standalone programs. PowerPoint is part of Microsoft Office while Keynote and Pages are included in Apple’s iWork suite. PowerPoint is available for Windows and Macintosh computers; Keynote and Pages are only available for Macs. All three are commercial programs. However, Microsoft does offer a free PowerPoint viewer. The free program enables you to view or run a PowerPoint presentation, but does not include editing capabilities.

##  Purpose
PowerPoint and Keynote are programs specifically designed for creating presentations. They both feature templates that enable you to create presentations for a myriad of purposes and audiences. While it is possible to create documents that you can disseminate as presentations with Pages, it is primarily a word processing program more suited for writing papers. The default layout of PowerPoint and Keynote enable you to edit directly on slides for a presentation, while Pages has a traditional word processing layout.


 
## Presentation Features

Both PowerPoint and Keynote enable you to create autorun or manual slide shows. You can add numerous multimedia elements to the slide shows, including music, images, sound effects and video. You can also import charts you create in spreadsheet programs. All three programs enable you to use any font you have installed on your computer and create text boxes and bullet points.

## Word Processing Features

Since Pages is a dedicated word processing program, its features for creating long, text-based documents far outweigh those in PowerPoint and Keynote. The default layout for creating and printing documents in Pages is portrait, while it is landscape for PowerPoint and Keynote. The word processing features of Pages not available in PowerPoint and Keynote include the ability to create mail merges, templates, complex tables of content and index sections and form letter merging.

## Conversion and Importing

PowerPoint, Keynote and Pages all have features that enable you to import documents from other programs; However, these import and conversion features vary for each program. While you can import PDFs and numerous types of media files into PowerPoint, you cannot import Keynote or Pages native files. If you are working within Keynote you can save a file in PowerPoint format and then open it from within the Microsoft program. On the other hand, you can import a PowerPoint file into Keynote, but you cannot import Pages documents into Keynote or vice versa. You cannot import Keynote or PowerPoint files into Pages.
